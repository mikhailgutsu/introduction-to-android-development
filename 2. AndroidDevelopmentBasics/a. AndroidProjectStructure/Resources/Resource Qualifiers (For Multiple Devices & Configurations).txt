Android supports resource qualifiers to provide alternative resources for different screen sizes, orientations, and languages.

Examples:

res/layout-land/ → Layouts for landscape mode.
res/values-es/ → Strings for Spanish locale.
res/drawable-hdpi/ → Images for high-density screens.
res/values-night/ → Colors and styles for dark mode.
